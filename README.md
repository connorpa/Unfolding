#Exercise unfolding

 - controlled environment with analytical physics cross section
 - change the resolution function
 - find binning automatically
 - plot ABPS
 - show RM
 - study model dependance
 - compare unfolding methods
 - tune unfolding methods
 - different sampling methods for RM
 - test effect of trigger inefficiency

The main function produces PDF and ROOT files with all results. The code has been developed with Root6 and RooUnfold.

*Note*: the code is not intended to be used to unfolded real data.

To download RooUnfold:
