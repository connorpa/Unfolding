#Exercise unfolding

 - controlled environment with analytical physics cross section
 - change the resolution function
 - find binning automatically
 - plot ABPS
 - show RM
 - study model dependance
 - vary unfolding method
 - vary the way to build up the RM

The main function produces PDF and ROOT files with all results. The code has been developed with Root6 and RooUnfold.

*Note*: the code is not to be used to unfolded real data.
